Challenges - Replacing Manual feaeture extraction
- In the manual feature extraction the point clouds are projected in top-view, and then apply the image based feature extraction methods are used for the detection. But these techniques cause an information bottleneck and cannot extract the 3D information required to detect the tasks.
